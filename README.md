XI (attacking 4231): Raya; Timber, Saliba, Kiwior, Lewis-Skelly; Rice, Partey, Ødegaard; Saka, Merino, Martinelli.
Tactical Overview
Real Madrid: Should start in an attacking formation, could switch to a more advanced 4-2-4 to overload the flanks against Arsenal. Mbappé and Vinícius will seek counterattacks, and Valverde and Modric will thump for control in midfield. High pressing and set pieces will prove crucial.
Arsenal: Will drop deep and attempt to absorb pressure to counter through Saka and Martinelli. Rice and Partey will provide protection for the back line, and set pieces remain an important weapon.

Real Madrid have never overturned a three-goal deficit in a Champions League knockout tie.
